4,Crunch,"The crunch is a popular core exercise targeting the rectus abdominis, or ""six-pack"" muscles, as well as the obliques.

It can be performed for time or reps as part of the ab-focused portion of any workout.",Strength,Abdominals,Bands,Intermediate,,
5,Decline band press sit-up,"The decline band press sit-up is a weighted core exercise that works the rectus abdominis or ""six pack"" muscles, as well as the deep core muscles.

24,Double Kettlebell Swing,,Strength,Abdominals,Kettlebells,Intermediate,,
25,Burpee over kettlebell,"The burpee over kettlebell is a more advanced version of a popular conditioning exercise.

28,Two-way swing,"The two-way kettlebell swing is an exercise that alternates a chest-height kettlebell swing (sometimes called a ""Russian"" or ""hardstyle"" swing) with an overhead kettlebell swing (sometimes called an ""American"" swing). Both swing variations work many of the same muscles, such as the hamstrings, glutes, and core, but because the weight must travel farther in the overhead swing, it's slightly more metabolically demanding and works the upper back and shoulders more. This combo can be performed for time or reps and works especially well in circuit-style or full-body training. If you can't perform the overhead swing without lower back or shoulder pain, just perform the chest-height swing.",Strength,Abdominals,Kettlebells,Intermediate,,
29,Kettlebell crab reach,"The kettlebell crab reach is a kettlebell pressing exercise in which the lifter presses a kettlebell overhead while in a modified single-arm bridge position.
